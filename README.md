* In this project, there are six sections to show the evaluation process of a teaching model as well as a prediction to the future. We use statistical methodology and machine learning algrithm through a specific case study. My goal is to provide a possible, feasible and reliable method to solve educational questions that challenge us in the long run.
* The dataset is from a student cohort who are at a college level, and a study general math course. 
* At the beginning, or rather to say, in the first section, I gave a visual description to the data in order to provide an overview of the data and the project question I tried to solve. From analysis to the data, we only provide an initial assumption from a small dataset before obtaining a full dataset that could fit the request for further analysis through machine learning techniques. 
* In the next few sections, I first conducted dimensional reduction analysis, then proceeded to feature selection for filtering out those unimportant features. 
* I was promoted to either use existing models, or construct my own models, and offered an accuracy to model predictions.
* I further conducted cross validation to predict by using a model I selected after model evaluation.
