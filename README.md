# Tool: R-, Python-, Excel
* In this project, thare are about six sections to show evaluation of a teaching model as well as a prediction to a future data. We use statistical methodology and machine learning algrithm through a specific case study. My goal is to provide a possible, feasible and reliable method to solve some educational questions that challenge us in a long run.
* The dataset is from a student cohort who are at a college level, and a study general math course. 
* At the beginning, or the first section, I gave a visuable description to the data in order to provide an overview of the data and the project question I tried to solve. From analysis to the data, we only provode an initial impression and assumptions until we are offered a full dataset that could fit the request for further analysis through machine leanring techniques. 
* In the next few sections, I first conducted dimentional reduction analysis, then proceeded to feature selection for filting out those unimportant features. 
* Since I was promosted to either use existed models, or constructed my own models, and offered an occurancy to model predictions.
* I further conducted cross validation to predict by using a model I selected.
