* In this project, there are six sections to show the evaluation process of a teaching model as well as a prediction. We use statistical methodology and machine learning algrithm through a specific case study. My goal is to provide a possible, feasible and reliable method to solve educational questions that challenge us in the long run.
* The dataset is extracted from a college group who study general math courses. 
* At the beginning, I give a visual description to the data in order to provide an overview of the data and the project questions I am trying to solve. After analyzing a small data, I make an initial assumption before obtaining a full dataset that will allow for further analysis using machine learning techniques. 
* In the next few sections, I first will conduct dimensional reduction analysis, then proceed to feature selection in order to filter out those unimportant features. 
* After completing analysis to the models, I offer an assessment of the accuracy of model predictions.
* I further conduct cross validation to do prediction after the model evaluation.
* Finally, I will give a selection to models have constructed
