# Tool: R-, Python-, Excel
In this project, thare are about 6 sections to show evaluation of a teaching model and its prediction. Using technology to give analysis in a statistical way. Particularily, we will introduce machine learning algrithm through the specific case study to provide possible, more feasible and reliable outcomes when other statistical methodology are not avilable.
The dataset is from a student cohort who are in a college level, and a study general math course. 
In the beginning, or the first section, I gave a visuable description for the data in order to provide an overview to the data. From analysis to the data, we only provode an initial impression and assumptions until we offered a full dataset that fit for analysis through machine leanring techniques. 
In the next few sections, we will first conduct dimentional reduction, then proceed to feature selection for filting out those unimportant features. 
Since we are confortable to either using existed models, or construct our own models, offered the occurancy to model prediction
We further conduct cross validation to predict using a model we selected.
