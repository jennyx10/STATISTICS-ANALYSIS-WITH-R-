* In this project, there are six sections to show evalution process of a teaching model as well as a prediction to the future . We use statistical methodology and machine learning algrithm through a specific case study. My goal is to provide a possible, feasible and reliable method to solve some educational questions that challenge us in a long run.
* The dataset is from a student cohort who are at a college level, and a study general math course. 
* At the beginning, or the first section, I gave a visuable description to the data in order to provide an overview of the data and the project question I tried to solve. From analysis to the data, we only provode an initial assumptions from a small dataset before obtaing a full dataset that could fit the request for further analysis through machine leanring techniques. 
* In the next few sections, I first conducted dimentional reduction analysis, then proceeded to feature selection for filting out those unimportant features. 
* I was promosted to either use existed models, or constructed my own models, and offered an occurancy to model predictions.
* I further conducted cross validation to predict by using a model I selected after model evalution.
